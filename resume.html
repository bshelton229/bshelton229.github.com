  <h1>Resumé</h1>
  <p>
    I have been developing for the web for over 10 years. I’m currently working primarily with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PHP, and Node.js. I absolutely love what I do, and love continually learning. I love working with open source, and contributing back whatever I can. I work with the entire stack; from the UI, to DevOps. I really enjoy working in a collaborative team environment.

  <h2>Recent Work History</h2>

  <h3>Web Developer, University of Wisconsin Madison <small>Madison, WI 2011-present</small></h3>
  <p>
  I am currently a web developer in the department of University Communications at UW-Madison. I develop and maintain applications written in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including: Ruby, PHP, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Wordpress. I’m responsible for programming and maintaining APIs which are consumed by a variety of services around campus. I am really fortunate to have been given the opportunity to be the lead developer of the new http://map.wisc.edu campus map, using a lot of outstanding open source technologies, including: Ruby on Rails, RGeo, PostGIS, Leaflet.js, TileMill, and OpenStreetMap data. The goal was to create a responsive web based campus map that was as performant as we could make it on mobile devices, as well as to provide spatial web services for campus. The map has been some of the most fun I’ve had professionally. I also do a lot of DevOps and server administration work to support our applications. I was given the opportunity to give a talk, alongside my boss, at FOSS4GNA; which was a great time.

  <h3>Web Developer, University Communications Department of the University of Colorado Boulder <small>Boulder, CO 2006-2011</small></h3>
  <p>
  I developed for Drupal and Wordpress, as well as wrote custom web applications in Ruby on Rails and PHP. I also served as the department server administrator. I was part of an agile team responsible for creating a large scale Drupal infrastructure to power top level colorado.edu sites, including http://colorado.edu. I had the opportunity to be a part of all layers of the stack, including initial development of https://drupal.org/project/dslm to help manage site installation and upgrades.

  <h3>IT and Production Manager, Copy Experts <small>Boulder, CO 2001-2006</small></h3>
  <p>
    Copy Experts is a small, locally owned, sustainable printing company in Boulder, Colorado. I was responsible for their website, FTP servers, store file servers, ldap user directory, and point of sale system; as well as being responsible for their production workflow. As the industry changed, I had the opportunity to bring the company into the digital printing age, designing the PDF and digital design/imposition workflow the company still uses today. I also built job submission functionality into their website. The owner, Kelly Nowlin, has remained one of my closest friends to this day.
