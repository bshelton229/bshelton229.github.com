<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I have been developing for the web for over 10 years. Iâ€™m currently working primarily with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PHP, and Node.js. I absolutely love what I do, and love continually learning. I love working with open source. I work with the entire stack, from the UI, to DevOps. I really enjoy working in a collaborative team environment.</p>
