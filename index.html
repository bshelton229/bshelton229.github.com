        Web Developer, University of Wisconsin Madison
        <small>2011-present</small>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am currently a web developer for the department of University Communications at UW-Madison, working remotely from the Seattle area, after moving from Wisconsin a few months ago. I develop and maintain applications written in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including: Ruby on Rails, PHP, Node.js, and Wordpress. I am really fortunate to have been given the opportunity to be the lead developer of the new
        <a href="http://map.wisc.edu" target="_blank">map.wisc.edu</a>
        campus map, using a lot of outstanding open source technologies, including: Ruby on Rails, RGeo, PostGIS, Leaflet.js, TileMill, and OpenStreetMap data.
      </p>
      <p>The goal was to create a responsive web based campus map that performed well on mobile devices, as well as to provide spatial web services for campus. The map has been some of the most fun I’ve had professionally. I also do a lot of DevOps and server administration work to support our applications. I was given the opportunity to give a talk, alongside my boss, at FOSS4GNA; which was a great time.</p>

      <p>
        I developed for Drupal and Wordpress and wrote custom web applications in Ruby on Rails and PHP. I also served as the department server administrator.

        I was part of an agile team responsible for creating a large scale Drupal infrastructure to power top level colorado.edu sites, including
        <a href="http://colorado.edu" target="_blank">http://colorado.edu.</a>

      <h3>
        IT and Production Manager, Copy Experts
        <small>2001-2006</small>
      </h3>
      <p>Copy Experts is a small, locally owned, sustainable printing company in Boulder, Colorado. I was responsible for their website, FTP servers, store file servers, ldap user directory, and point of sale system; as well as being responsible for their production workflow. As the industry changed, I had the opportunity to bring the company into the digital printing age, designing the PDF and digital design/imposition workflow the company still uses today. I also built job submission functionality into their website. The owner, Kelly Nowlin, has remained one of my closest friends to this day.</p>
